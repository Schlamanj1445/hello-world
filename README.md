Hello Humans!

I am a space traveler from a moon right under your nose.  Based on our celestial observations, a massive asteroid capable of wiping out your species is on its way.  You do not have the technology to stop it.  The devastation will be quite total and the tardigrades will have to start your evolution over, AGAIN. Humans make great tacos; however, next go round try to work a little harder as a collective to get with the program.  Like, a space program. 

Bye, Felicia!
